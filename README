## A simple crawler for weibo posts

### Background

For some reason, I wanna collect data in a period of time on weibo.com, so I designed this crawler.

It does the following things:

- mimic the ajaxlogin behavior in JavaScript on the site, and save the cookie
- start 2 kinds of threads
	- getUidThread
		- start from a single user, get at most the first 5 pages of follower list of him/her
	- getPostsThread
		- getting 10 pages of posts from uids gotten by getUidThread
- when receive SIGINT, shutdown all threads, and write uids in queues into files
